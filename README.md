## Introduction

Hi, I am Zahra Mohammed!

I am currently a student with a background in Computer Science. I have an interest in technology and coding, and I am particularly interested in machine learning and how it can be used to solve real-world problems.

Looking forward to learning more about machine learning in ARTI 308!
